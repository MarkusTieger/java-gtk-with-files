/**
 * A helper class for testing code which uses D-Bus without touching the user's
 * <br>session bus.
 * <br>
 * <br>Note that &#35;GTestDBus modifies the userâ€™s environment, calling setenv().
 * <br>This is not thread-safe, so all &#35;GTestDBus calls should be completed before
 * <br>threads are spawned, or should have appropriate locking to ensure no access
 * <br>conflicts to environment variables shared between &#35;GTestDBus and other
 * <br>threads.
 * <br>
 * <br>&#35;&#35; Creating unit tests using GTestDBus
 * <br>
 * <br>Testing of D-Bus services can be tricky because normally we only ever run
 * <br>D-Bus services over an existing instance of the D-Bus daemon thus we
 * <br>usually don't activate D-Bus services that are not yet installed into the
 * <br>target system. The &#35;GTestDBus object makes this easier for us by taking care
 * <br>of the lower level tasks such as running a private D-Bus daemon and looking
 * <br>up uninstalled services in customizable locations, typically in your source
 * <br>code tree.
 * <br>
 * <br>The first thing you will need is a separate service description file for the
 * <br>D-Bus daemon. Typically a `services` subdirectory of your `tests` directory
 * <br>is a good place to put this file.
 * <br>
 * <br>The service file should list your service along with an absolute path to the
 * <br>uninstalled service executable in your source tree. Using autotools we would
 * <br>achieve this by adding a file such as `my-server.service.in` in the services
 * <br>directory and have it processed by configure.
 * <pre>
 *     [D-BUS Service]
 *     Name=org.gtk.GDBus.Examples.ObjectManager
 *     Exec=&#64;abs_top_builddir&#64;/gio/tests/gdbus-example-objectmanager-server
 * </pre>
 * <br>You will also need to indicate this service directory in your test
 * <br>fixtures, so you will need to pass the path while compiling your
 * <br>test cases. Typically this is done with autotools with an added
 * <br>preprocessor flag specified to compile your tests such as:
 * <pre>
 *     -DTEST_SERVICES=&#92;&quot;&quot;$(abs_top_builddir)/tests/services&quot;&#92;&quot;
 * </pre>
 * <br>    Once you have a service definition file which is local to your source tree,
 * <br>you can proceed to set up a GTest fixture using the &#35;GTestDBus scaffolding.
 * <br>
 * <br>An example of a test fixture for D-Bus services can be found
 * <br>here:
 * <br>[gdbus-test-fixture.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gdbus-test-fixture.c)
 * <br>
 * <br>Note that these examples only deal with isolating the D-Bus aspect of your
 * <br>service. To successfully run isolated unit tests on your service you may need
 * <br>some additional modifications to your test case fixture. For example; if your
 * <br>service uses GSettings and installs a schema then it is important that your test service
 * <br>not load the schema in the ordinary installed location (chances are that your service
 * <br>and schema files are not yet installed, or worse; there is an older version of the
 * <br>schema file sitting in the install location).
 * <br>
 * <br>Most of the time we can work around these obstacles using the
 * <br>environment. Since the environment is inherited by the D-Bus daemon
 * <br>created by &#35;GTestDBus and then in turn inherited by any services the
 * <br>D-Bus daemon activates, using the setup routine for your fixture is
 * <br>a practical place to help sandbox your runtime environment. For the
 * <br>rather typical GSettings case we can work around this by setting
 * <br>`GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR` to the in tree directory holding your schemas
 * <br>in the above fixture_setup() routine.
 * <br>
 * <br>The GSettings schemas need to be locally pre-compiled for this to work. This can be achieved
 * <br>by compiling the schemas locally as a step before running test cases, an autotools setup might
 * <br>do the following in the directory holding schemas:
 * <pre>
 *     all-am:
 *             $(GLIB_COMPILE_SCHEMAS) .
 * 
 *     CLEANFILES += gschemas.compiled
 * </pre>
