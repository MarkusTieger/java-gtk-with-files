/**
 * GIOStream represents an object that has both read and write streams.
 * <br>Generally the two streams act as separate input and output streams,
 * <br>but they share some common resources and state. For instance, for
 * <br>seekable streams, both streams may use the same position.
 * <br>
 * <br>Examples of &#35;GIOStream objects are &#35;GSocketConnection, which represents
 * <br>a two-way network connection; and &#35;GFileIOStream, which represents a
 * <br>file handle opened in read-write mode.
 * <br>
 * <br>To do the actual reading and writing you need to get the substreams
 * <br>with g_io_stream_get_input_stream() and g_io_stream_get_output_stream().
 * <br>
 * <br>The &#35;GIOStream object owns the input and the output streams, not the other
 * <br>way around, so keeping the substreams alive will not keep the &#35;GIOStream
 * <br>object alive. If the &#35;GIOStream object is freed it will be closed, thus
 * <br>closing the substreams, so even if the substreams stay alive they will
 * <br>always return %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED for all operations.
 * <br>
 * <br>To close a stream use g_io_stream_close() which will close the common
 * <br>stream object and also the individual substreams. You can also close
 * <br>the substreams themselves. In most cases this only marks the
 * <br>substream as closed, so further I/O on it fails but common state in the
 * <br>&#35;GIOStream may still be open. However, some streams may support
 * <br>&quot;half-closed&quot; states where one direction of the stream is actually shut down.
 * <br>
 * <br>Operations on &#35;GIOStreams cannot be started while another operation on the
 * <br>&#35;GIOStream or its substreams is in progress. Specifically, an application can
 * <br>read from the &#35;GInputStream and write to the &#35;GOutputStream simultaneously
 * <br>(either in separate threads, or as asynchronous operations in the same
 * <br>thread), but an application cannot start any &#35;GIOStream operation while there
 * <br>is a &#35;GIOStream, &#35;GInputStream or &#35;GOutputStream operation in progress, and
 * <br>an application canâ€™t start any &#35;GInputStream or &#35;GOutputStream operation
 * <br>while there is a &#35;GIOStream operation in progress.
 * <br>
 * <br>This is a product of individual stream operations being associated with a
 * <br>given &#35;GMainContext (the thread-default context at the time the operation was
 * <br>started), rather than entire streams being associated with a single
 * <br>&#35;GMainContext.
 * <br>
 * <br>GIO may run operations on &#35;GIOStreams from other (worker) threads, and this
 * <br>may be exposed to application code in the behaviour of wrapper streams, such
 * <br>as &#35;GBufferedInputStream or &#35;GTlsConnection. With such wrapper APIs,
 * <br>application code may only run operations on the base (wrapped) stream when
 * <br>the wrapper stream is idle. Note that the semantics of such operations may
 * <br>not be well-defined due to the state the wrapper stream leaves the base
 * <br>stream in (though they are guaranteed not to crash).
