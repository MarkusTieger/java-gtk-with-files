/**
 * A &#35;GSocket is a low-level networking primitive. It is a more or less
 * <br>direct mapping of the BSD socket API in a portable GObject based API.
 * <br>It supports both the UNIX socket implementations and winsock2 on Windows.
 * <br>
 * <br>&#35;GSocket is the platform independent base upon which the higher level
 * <br>network primitives are based. Applications are not typically meant to
 * <br>use it directly, but rather through classes like &#35;GSocketClient,
 * <br>&#35;GSocketService and &#35;GSocketConnection. However there may be cases where
 * <br>direct use of &#35;GSocket is useful.
 * <br>
 * <br>&#35;GSocket implements the &#35;GInitable interface, so if it is manually constructed
 * <br>by e.g. g_object_new() you must call g_initable_init() and check the
 * <br>results before using the object. This is done automatically in
 * <br>g_socket_new() and g_socket_new_from_fd(), so these functions can return
 * <br>%NULL.
 * <br>
 * <br>Sockets operate in two general modes, blocking or non-blocking. When
 * <br>in blocking mode all operations (which donâ€™t take an explicit blocking
 * <br>parameter) block until the requested operation
 * <br>is finished or there is an error. In non-blocking mode all calls that
 * <br>would block return immediately with a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error.
 * <br>To know when a call would successfully run you can call g_socket_condition_check(),
 * <br>or g_socket_condition_wait(). You can also use g_socket_create_source() and
 * <br>attach it to a &#35;GMainContext to get callbacks when I/O is possible.
 * <br>Note that all sockets are always set to non blocking mode in the system, and
 * <br>blocking mode is emulated in GSocket.
 * <br>
 * <br>When working in non-blocking mode applications should always be able to
 * <br>handle getting a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error even when some other
 * <br>function said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case
 * <br>of a race condition in the application, but it can also happen for other
 * <br>reasons. For instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable
 * <br>until a write returns %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.
 * <br>
 * <br>&#35;GSockets can be either connection oriented or datagram based.
 * <br>For connection oriented types you must first establish a connection by
 * <br>either connecting to an address or accepting a connection from another
 * <br>address. For connectionless socket types the target/source address is
 * <br>specified or received in each I/O operation.
 * <br>
 * <br>All socket file descriptors are set to be close-on-exec.
 * <br>
 * <br>Note that creating a &#35;GSocket causes the signal %SIGPIPE to be
 * <br>ignored for the remainder of the program. If you are writing a
 * <br>command-line utility that uses &#35;GSocket, you may need to take into
 * <br>account the fact that your program will not automatically be killed
 * <br>if it tries to write to %stdout after it has been closed.
 * <br>
 * <br>Like most other APIs in GLib, &#35;GSocket is not inherently thread safe. To use
 * <br>a &#35;GSocket concurrently from multiple threads, you must implement your own
 * <br>locking.
